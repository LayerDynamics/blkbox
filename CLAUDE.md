# Claude Code instructions

this application which is a modern day honey pot
built with deno ffi methods and rust ffi methods, packages and a
deployable application that uses all of the ffi, packages to provide
a honeypot that tracks, traces, and tries to find out as much info
about the attacker as possible without giving away its not the real
server, it should draw the attackers in and get them to use methods
that possibly disclose their location or mac addresses. you are
required to us the files and folders that are there, and follow the
naming conventions of each package/lib/app. you are required to
provide real world working methods, and never provide placeholder,
for now, simulated, mock, simplified methods but instead the real
logic and code needed to work as intended and expected, # BlkBox - a
modern, subversive, honeypot.

**A very resilient, modern, honeypot that comes with some strike back
 offensive abbilities**
